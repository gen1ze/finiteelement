# finiteelement
this code is to solve 1d bar elements subjected to point loads only.By default node 1 is fixed and no point load acts there accept the reaction due to other forces.
Note while entering force vector(column matrix) you need to input first force which act on node 1 as -ve of reaction force(entering anything other then that will not affect the result) )
